## Abstract
The thesis focuses on defining the concept of ultrafilters and investigating certain properties of a particular topological space closely related to the set of natural numbers in the context of the general notion of Stone-Čech compactification. It is shown that a topology can be introduced on the family of all ultrafilters of subsets of the natural numbers, resulting in a space that is homeomorphic to the Stone-Čech compactification of the original set of natural numbers. This newly defined space is notable as its study yields various results that extend beyond the realm of general topology.

Furthermore, the space serves as a prototype for investigating the Stone-Čech compactification, enabling the easier proof of specific theorems in this context, which can later be generalized to broader results. 

The thesis is structured as follows: 
- **Chapter 1**: An overview of compactifications, including the Stone-Čech compactification.
- **Chapter 2**: Definition of filters and ultrafilters, introducing a particular topology on the family of all ultrafilters for a given set.
- **Chapter 3**: Exploration of the properties of a specific space that serves as a special case of those described in Chapter 2.

The work integrates approaches from several general studies referenced in the bibliography and presents proofs that were either summarized or omitted in those texts.

**Language**: The thesis is written in Polish.
